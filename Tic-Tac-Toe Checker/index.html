      // If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!
      // Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:

      //   [
      //     [0, 0, 1],
      //     [0, 1, 2],
      //     [2, 1, 0],
      //   ];

      //       We want our function to return:
      // -1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
      // 1 if "X" won,
      // 2 if "O" won,
      // 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
      // You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
